Ahmedabad: A faculty
member at Ahmedabad
University has developed a
method to identify indivi-
. dual crocodiles based on
aerial images, which can be
used to understand croco-
â€¢ diles' habitats and migra-
. tion patterns.
Ratna Ghosal, an assi-
stant professor at the uni-
versity, was co-author of
the paper 'Identification of
free-rangingmuggercroco-
diles by applying deep lear-
ning methods on UAV ima-
gery', which was recently
published in the Elsevier
. journal Ecological Infor-
matics.
"The biometric tool
identifies mugger crocodi-
les or marsh crocodiles ba-
sed on the pattern of their
bony external plate, known
as scute. Each crocodile has
a unique pattern which can
be identified by artificial
intelligence (Al). We have
so far developed a library of
143 crocodiles in three dif-
ferent habitats - Kutch,
Anand and Vadodara di9
tricts. " Ghosal told TOI.
"The library can be ex-
panded by drone images

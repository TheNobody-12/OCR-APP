just that pleasure and pain no longer dictate most de-
- They are no longer the basis of our values. Older
their personal feelings agains't their understand-
of rules, trade-offs, and the social order around them to plan
make decisions. This gives them larger, sturdier identities."
The adolescent does the same stumbling around the young
child does in learning what is pleasurable and what is painful, ex-
apt the adolescent stumbles around by trying on different social
rules and roles. If I wear this, will it make me cool? If I talk like
that, will it make people like me? If I pretend to enjoy this music,
ml] I be popular?19
This is an improvement, but there's still a weakness in this ad-
descent approach to life. Everything is seen as a trade-off. Adoles-
cents approach life as an endless series of bargains: I will do what
my boss says so I can get money. I will call my mother so I don't
get yelled at. I will do my homework so I don't fuck up my future.
I '*ill lie and pretend to be nice so I don't have to deal with conflict.
Nothing is done for its own sake. Everything is a calculated
transaction, usually made out of fear of the negative repercus-
nlpnqurable end. 20

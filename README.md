## Problem Statement
In the factory floor, the Engineer enters data on the sheet. This sheet at the end of the repair cycle, 
manufacturing process, etc. is manually entered into the database. This manual process is timeconsuming and repetitive. Currently, there are OCR technologies that do not perform well with 
Cursive Handwritten data. Build a Deep learning OCR and Azure services that which can work with Cursive 
handwritten data. Since each individual has a different handwriting style. There should be a 
mechanism to collect data from different users (different handwriting styles.) and train the models 
for improved performance of the OCR for each user.

## Description
In many automobile and manufacturing industries, a huge amount of data is handwritten. Still, in 
many government sectors in India, the document are handwritten. Optical character recognition 
makes it possible to convert many kinds of texts or photos into editable, searchable, and analyzable 
data. Researchers have been using AI and ML methods to automatically evaluate printed and 
handwritten documents for the past ten years in order to digitize them. Industries use paper sheets to 
enter data collected during work. This data is then manually entered into a database for further 
usage. But manually entering the data can be tedious work. So to solve this problem we can use the 
Optical Character Recognition technique, which is widely used to detect handwritten cursive text. 
We need this technology because if the data entered is misinterpreted by humans it can lead to 
failure or loss to the industry.
